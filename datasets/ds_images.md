# Image size differences
As we know the images from the database for each domain are from google images and they have the same size.
*The following are in the format (width x height)*
- Tokyo Database: 640x480
- SF-XS (test) Database: 512x512

It's not the same for images from queries that are from different sources and they have different sizes.
